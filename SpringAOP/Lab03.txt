You have Account.java as given below.

public class Account{
	private String accountNumber;
	private double balance = 1000.00;
	public String getAccountNumber(){
		return accountNumber;
	}
	public void setAccountNumber(String accNum){
		accountNumber = accNum;
	}
	public double getBalance(){
		return balance;
	}
	public void setBalance(double balance){
		this.balance = balance;
	}
	public void deposit(double amount){
		balance += amount;
	}
	public void withdraw(double amount){
		balance -= amount;
	}
}


Use AOP to implement the following
1) Minimum withdraw amount should be $500.
2) Disallow withdraw if the amount is greater than the balance; 3) The minimum balance of the Account should always be maintained at $1000.
4) Print the new balance after every deposit and withdraw operation

Whenever withdraw method is denied append a message to a log file "accounts.log" specifying the accountNumber and a message like this.
*******************************
AccountNumber: 1000
Message: Withdraw denied for $500 at <date and time>
*******************************
