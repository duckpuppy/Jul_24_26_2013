Create a controller 'SessionsController'
This controller will be used to maintain a list of topics along with their duration and an auto-generated unique id. 
You should be able to add, list and show topics.
Implement in the RESTful style. For example.

If you enter the URL
http://<server>/topic/add/Ruby/60

Ruby course gets added to the list with a unique id and you get a message "Ruby successfully added to db: Id is 101"

The URL
http://<server>/topic/show/101
The output is "Ruby(60 mins)"

If you type the URL
http://<server>/topic/add/Groovy/45

Grails course gets added to the list with a unique id and you get a message "Groovy successfully added to db; Id is 102"

If you type the URL
http://<server>/topic/list
The output is a JSON formatted list

{"topics":[{title:"Ruby",duration:60},{"title":"Groovy",duration:45}]}

You will use the table 'topics' in any database in mysql.
create table topics(
	id int(5) not null primary key auto_increment,
	title varchar(50),
	duration int(4)
);
 
Create  ConferenceService and TopicsDao classes. Create additional classes if required.
Configure these beans in applicationContext.xml file.
